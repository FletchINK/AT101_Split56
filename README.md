_Notes on Layer 1_

4 to Alt F4 seemed obvious since I don't use F4 for anything else
A to Alt+Tab as a quick switch in windows.
D to Ctrl+L evolved from Alt+D to get to the URL bar, but Ctrl+L is more universal and reliable in windows which chokes on Alts some times
C and V to Ctrl+C and V are easy shortcuts when you're already holding down FN

HJKL to arrow keys because Vim
N and M to Del and Backspace keep those keys near eachother and make Control on the left easier
< and > to Ctrl+Shift+Tab and Ctrl+Tab is about switching between browser tabs easily
i and o are macros to Ctrl+B,p (switch to prevous buffer in tmux) and Ctrl+B,Ctrl+o (switch panes and focus on new pane)
' to enter is trying to work around the muscle memory. It's not working so far.
